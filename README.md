# Overengineered JS Snake Game

An overengineered browser-based snake game. Written in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. No libraries, frameworks, or any weird shits. The game uses Canvas API, so no quirky WebGL either. Just a simple green and black snake game with red square as a fruit, a score counter, and that's it!
